Crontab entry to run the time synchronization script every 30 minutes.

This should be added to the root user's crontab ('sudo crontab -e')

to ensure the script has permissions to change the system time.

- '*/30 * * * *' means "at minute 0 and 30 past every hour."

- '/usr/bin/python3' is the absolute path to the Python interpreter.

- '/home/student/sync_time.py' is the (assumed) absolute path to your script.

(You MUST update this path to match where you save the script).

- '>> /var/log/time_sync.log 2>&1' appends all output (stdout and stderr)

to a log file, which is essential for debugging.

*/30 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/student/sync_time.py >> /var/log/time_sync.log 2>&1
